# ¡Hey pal, I am Miguel Timote! 🤖

👾 I am a game developer especially in Unity. I am 20 years old and I am a great enthusiast in all the knowledge that can be acquired, mainly about videogame design and development.
🤩 I also have a focus on UX/UI design and creating intuitive and attractive prototypes for the user.

## What I am doing right now? 🦉

* As a Freelancer I develop independent video games in the Unity engine mainly for Game Jams, but to date I find myself developing one of the games that I was most excited to make, which has already been in development for several months and still has many more to be released.
* Developing and enhancing the CodeBits Unisabana community to offer new workshops with the latest technologies and freelancer opportunities.
